/**
 * {@code SmallD} is the entry point for the SmallD API. The methods here can be divided into three
 * categories: Lifecycle, Gateway, and Resources.
 *
 * <p>The Lifecycle methods manage the lifecycle of the connection to Discord. The one that is most
 * likely required is {@link #run()}. {@link #run()} will connect to Discord and block until the
 * connection is closed. If greater control of the connection lifecycle is required the other
 * methods involved in the lifecycle are available to be used as well (e.g., {@link #connect()},
 * {@link #await()}).
 *
 * <p>The Gateway methods allow paylods to be sent to Discord and for execution of listeners upon
 * receiving a payload.
 *
 * <p>The Resource methods allow for sending of requests to Discord's REST API. These are named
 * after the possible HTTP methods (e.g., {@link #get(String)}).
