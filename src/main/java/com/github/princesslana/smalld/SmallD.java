/**
 * {@code SmallD} is the entry point for the SmallD API. The methods here can be divided into three

 * <p>The Lifecycle methods manage the lifecycle of the connection to Discord. {@link #run()} will
 * connect to Discord and block until the {@link #close()} is called.
 *
 * <p>The Gateway methods allow paylods to be sent to Discord and for execution of listeners upon
 * receiving a payload.
 *
 * <p>The Resource methods allow for sending of requests to Discord's REST API. These are named
 * after the possible HTTP methods (e.g., {@link #get(String)}).
